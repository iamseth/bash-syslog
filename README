A patch for Bash to log all actions to syslog in real time.

Logs to LOCAL5. If nothing else is logging to LOCAL5, you can do this to log all Bash output to it's own log file

local5.*						/var/log/bash.log

Otherwise, it'll go into messages or whatever is the "catch all".

I'm including the spec file, RPM for 64bit, and SRPM if you need to rebuild for 32bit or something.
